# Login-System
Initially created by following a tutorial on YouTube posted by Bro Code.

However, while the tutorial uses a HashMap to store usernames and passwords, I have created a MySQL database for this use. To the project, I added a JDBC and a method which sends a query to the database to check if the username and password are correct.
